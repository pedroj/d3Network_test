networkD3_test
==============

Tests for using networkD3 with bipartite networks. Based in [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)'s [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), and [networkD3 code](http://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/) in [R](http://www.r-project.org/) by [Christopher Gandrud](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.com/p/biocontact.html). These are great tools for creating interactive network graphs with JavaScript. But we still need some work to get them used for bipartite networks.
